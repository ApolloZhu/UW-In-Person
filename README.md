Potential classes offered in person at University of Washington for Autumn 2020.

## OwO What's This

ICE originally annouced a new policy requireing all F/M visa students to take some in-person classe(s) as UW is using a hybrid approach. The policy is now rescinded, hence I'm archiving this repository. You can contact me at zhuzhiyu@uw.edu if there's any change you want me to merge, or you could just maintain a fork of this project.
