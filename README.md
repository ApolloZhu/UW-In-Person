Potential classes offered in person at University of Washington for Autumn 2020.

## Public Service Annoucement

As stated in the new UW [presidential address](https://www.washington.edu/president/2020/07/07/rule-ends-visa-waiver/):

> if the virus resurges in Washington and we have to return to remote-only instruction, or if case counts arenâ€™t reduced enough to let us go to [Phase 3](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/status/#accordion1_tab4) in this region in time for autumn quarter, then international students could have their lives upended for no reason.

therefore, you're not gauranteed to be able to stay in United States even if you register for in-person classes.
